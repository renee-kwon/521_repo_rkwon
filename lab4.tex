\title{Lab 4 - Introduction to RStudio and R Markdown. Presentations}
\author{Renee Kwon}
\date{October 1, 2022}

In Lab 4, you will learn how to use, edit and create a R Markdown
document (like this one) using RStudio. You should follow the
instructions in this document to complete the assignment. Knit this
document to view the nicely rendered HTML, which can make it easier to
read the questions.

If you need help as you use R Markdown in this lab and others in the
future, consult the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-15.html}{Cheat sheet}
\item
  \href{https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/}{Home page with guides}
\item
  \href{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/}{Reference book}
\end{itemize}

The below is a code chunk, but instead of using the \texttt{r} engine
we're creating an alert block that will make the question show up with a
blue background in the HTML output. Unfortunately, this creates an error
when exporting to PDF, so it can only be used for HTML.

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{submission-instructions}{%
\subsection{Submission Instructions}\label{submission-instructions}}

rubric=\{mechanics:2\}

You receive marks for submitting your lab correctly, please follow these
instructions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \href{https://ubc-mds.github.io/resources_pages/general_lab_instructions/}{Follow
  the general lab instructions}.
\item
  \href{https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric}{Click here
  to view a description of the rubrics used to grade the questions}.
\item
  Push your \texttt{.Rmd} AND \textbf{all the files} you will create as
  part of the lab to your GitHub repository.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The reason for pushing all the files is that \texttt{.Rmd} does not
    contain the rendered output from running the cells. If someone is
    checking out your work there needs to be an HTML file to view the
    output, so it is good to get into this habit. - \texttt{.ipynb}
    renders nicely on GitHub, which is why we did not include the HTML
    file for previous labs.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Upload a \texttt{.Rmd} version of your assignment to Gradescope.
\item
  Include a clickable link to your GitHub repo for the lab just below
  this cell (it should look something like this
  \url{https://github.ubc.ca/MDS-2022-23/DSCI_521_labX_yourcwl}.

\hypertarget{editing-r-markdown-documents}{%
\subsection{Editing R Markdown
documents}\label{editing-r-markdown-documents}}

This document is called an R Markdown document. It is a literate code
document, similar to Jupyter notebooks where you can write code and view
its outputs. To start, let's set our working directory by creating a new
R Project for lab 4.

\hypertarget{text-and-rendering-r-markdown-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Text and rendering R Markdown
documents}\label{text-and-rendering-r-markdown-documents}}

In an R Markdown document, any line of text not in a code chunk (like
this line of text) will be formatted using Markdown. Similar to
JupyterLab, you can also use HTML and LaTeX here to do more advanced
formatting. To run a code chunk, you can press the green play button in
the top right corner of the chunk.

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-1}{%
\paragraph{Question 1}\label{question-1}}

rubric=\{correctness:1\}

To render the HTML files we are going to create, the first step is to
activate GitHub pages.
\end{alert alert-info}

\href{https://renee-kwon.github.io/Lab4Q1/}{\textbf{https://renee-kwon.github.io/Lab4Q1/}}

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-2}{%
\paragraph{Question 2}\label{question-2}}

rubric=\{mechanics:1\}

Create a new code chunk below using the r language engine that runs some
R code (it does not need to be complicated, but it should have an
output). Ensure that you can render/knit the document after you add that
chunk.
\end{alert alert-info}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x }\OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{3} 
\NormalTok{y }\OtherTok{=} \DecValTok{3}
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{ (x }\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{ y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 6
\end{verbatim}

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-3}{%
\paragraph{Question 3}\label{question-3}}

rubric=\{mechanics:1\}

Create a new code chunk, and add a meaningful name to the code chunk.
Try using the pop-up-like menu to navigate between the named code chunks
Don't forget to knit/render the document after you make this change to
ensure everything is still working.
\end{alert alert-info}

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-4}{%
\paragraph{Question 4}\label{question-4}}

rubric=\{mechanics:1,reasoning:1\}

Create a new code chunk that uses a code chunk option. Write out in your
own words what the code chunk option is doing.
\end{alert alert-info}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 6
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\emph{With the ``include'' option, if set to false (include=FALSE), the
output document will not include whatever is written in the code chunk,
but the code is still evaluated. If set to TRUE, the output will appear
in the output document (default is true). Therefore in our example,
codechunk named ``Q4OptionTrue'' and it's output is shown on the
document but ``Q4OptionFalse'' is not shown as it's include option is
set to false.}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{multiple-code-chunk-options}{%
\paragraph{Multiple code chunk
options}\label{multiple-code-chunk-options}}

To have multiple code chunk options you separate them by a comma. For
example, if in addition to suppressing warnings, we want to run the code
but not output the results, then we can add the
\texttt{include\ =\ FALSE} argument to the code chunk after the
\texttt{warning\ =\ FALSE} option.

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-5}{%
\paragraph{Question 5}\label{question-5}}

rubric=\{mechanics:1,reasoning:1\}

Create a new code chunk that uses at least two code chunk options. At
least one must be different to the ones mentioned above. Write in your
own words what each code chunk option is doing.
\end{alert alert-info}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{y)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] 6
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{print}\NormalTok{(x}\SpecialCharTok{+}\NormalTok{c)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Error in x + c: non-numeric argument to binary operator
\end{verbatim}

\begin{quote}
\emph{The ``comment'' option allows you to select a character string to
be printed in front of the code and output of that chunk in our output
document. In our case, we chose ``\#\#'' as the character string, so the
output document will print a ``\#\#'' our output, ``6'', above.}

\emph{The ``error'' option, enables display of error messages in the
output document. In our case, our error code returned for ``print(x+c)''
is displayed because we have set the ``error'' option to TRUE above.}
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{yaml-header-and-document-output-options}{%
\subsubsection{1.5. YAML Header and document output
options}\label{yaml-header-and-document-output-options}}

R Markdown files contains three types of content:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Plain text mixed with simple Markdown formatting.
\item
  Code chunks surrounded by ```.
\item
  An (optional) YAML header surrounded by \texttt{-\/-\/-}.
\end{enumerate}

You have been introduced the first two types of content, but not the
third (although you probably saw it at the top of this document). The
(optional) YAML header, which is located at the very top of R Markdown
files sets some general global parameters, including:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  title
\item
  author
\item
  output
\item
  etc
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Example YAML Header}

\begin{verbatim}
---
title: "Reproducible Data Science Report"
author: "Florencia D'Andrea"
date: "September 4, 2022"
output: html_document
---
\end{verbatim}

Most important from a workflow perspective is \textbf{output}. Possible
output options include:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{output:\ html\_document}
\item
  \texttt{output:\ md\_document}
\item
  \texttt{output:\ pdf\_document}
\item
  \texttt{output:\ word\_document}
\item
  \texttt{output:\ xaringan::moon\_reader} (xaringan presentation -
  html)
\end{itemize}

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-6}{%
\paragraph{Question 6}\label{question-6}}

rubric=\{mechanics:1\}

Navigate to the YAML header at the very top of this document and edit it
so that you include an \texttt{author} (yourself) and a \texttt{date}
(lab due date). Include what you added below here as well as a fenced
Markdown code block.
\end{alert alert-info}

\hypertarget{creating-r-markdown-documents}{%
\subsubsection{Creating R Markdown
documents}\label{creating-r-markdown-documents}}

You can use the ``File'' menu inside RStudio to create new R Markdown
documents by selecting: \textbf{File \textgreater{} New File
\textgreater{} R Markdown} This will bring you to another menu where you
can choose the type of output (don't be afraid to pick something, you
can always change the \texttt{output} type once you have the
\texttt{.Rmd} file).

To create a written report, we generally recommend using the default
\texttt{output:\ html\_document} as it is easier to read than PDF (note
- LaTeX does not render nicely in such documents sadly, so if you are
using a lot of LaTeX then you may want to choose
\texttt{output:\ pdf\_document}). If you want to create an \texttt{.md}
file to publish on GitHub, it is recommend to instead use
\texttt{output:\ github\_document}. To get this from the menu above you
need to navigate to the ``From Template'' option on the left panel and
then select ``GitHub Document (Markdown)''.

\begin{alert alert-info}
\hypertarget{question-7}{%
\paragraph{Question 7}\label{question-7}}

rubric=\{mechanics:2\}

1 - Create a new RMarkdown report (a different file than this one) in
the same directory as this RMarkdown file. Use \texttt{html\_document}
as the \texttt{output}. After you have rendered it, paste the link to
the HTML output as a link to your GitHub repository (remember to push
all your files!)

2 - Then, navigate to the YAML header at the very top of that
\texttt{.Rmd} document and edit it so that the \texttt{output} is
\texttt{pdf\_document}. Then knit/render the document. Note the
different output. Add and commit that rendered both the \texttt{.html}
and \texttt{.pdf} files to the GitHub repository for this lab and paste
the two links below this question.

rubric=\{mechanics:6\}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Go back to the \texttt{.Rmd} file you created in question 7, and
  include at least two Markdown text sections (each should have a
  header) and at least two separate code chunks in it (these can be
  really simple). Save the new R Markdown document and give it a new
  meaningful name.
\item
  Render/knit the new R Markdown document to get an \texttt{.html} file.
  Put the \texttt{.Rmd} document and the rendered \texttt{.html} file
  under version control using Git, and push/upload the file to your
  GitHub repository for this homework. Paste a link to these files as
  your answer below.

  to \texttt{github\_document} and render it. Put the rendered
  \texttt{.md} file under version control using Git, and push/upload the

\item
  Create a presentation using RStudio. Do this in a different file than
  this one but in the same directory as this RMarkdown file. You can use
  xaringan or Quarto to create the slides.
  \href{https://pages.github.ubc.ca/MDS-2022-23/DSCI_521_platforms-dsci_students/materials/lectures/8-rmarkdown-quarto-slides-ghpages.html}{On
  the book} you will find links that will guide you on how to create
  each type of slide. If you are not sure which one to use, it is safer
  to use Xaringan as Quarto is quite new and you will have to learn how
  to use \texttt{.qmd} files. But if you want to explore Quarto, we will
  accept both options (Xaringan or Quarto slides) as correct. Give this
  file a meaningful name.
\item
  Create at least 4 slides. At least two slides must include a code
  chunk or cell (these can be really simple). Save the new document.
\item
  Render/knit the new document to get a \texttt{html} presentation file.
\item
  Put the new document and the rendered \texttt{.html} file under
  version control using Git, and push/upload the file to your GitHub
  repository for this lab
\item
  Activate GitHub pages and paste the link below.
